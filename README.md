# reddit-link-scraper
reddit-link-scraper allows you to 'fish' for posts containing pre-defined keywords on reddit for you to look at later.
Features:
  Crawl subreddits and save posts containing pre-defined keywords into a json file. 
  Open all the saved posts in your browser for you to look at when you have time to go through them.

Example usage: 
  Crawl the 'hot' section of /r/gameassets saving posts containing "forest" and/or "tileset". Later, open these posts and determine if any are useful for your game.
