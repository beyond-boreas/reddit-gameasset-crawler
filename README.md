# reddit-link-saver
reddit-link-saver allows you to save reddit posts containing pre-defined keywords for you to look at later.

Features:

- Scan multiple subreddits and save posts containing pre-defined keywords into a file.
- Filter posts within a time period (hour/week/month/year).
- Filter posts within a reddit sort section (hot/top/new).
- Schedule scans to happen automatically (not yet implemented).
- Open all the saved posts in your browser for you to look at when you have time to go through them (not yet implemented).

Example use-case: Every day, crawl the 'hot' section of /r/gameassets saving posts containing "tile" and/or "tileset". Later, open these posts and determine if any are useful assets for your game.
